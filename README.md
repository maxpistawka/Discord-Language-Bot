# Discord-Language-Bot
This discord bot's main purpose is to act as a language helping bot. It can be modified to allows for the practice of
any language, however, it's main purpose is for the learning of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. I have around over a 
year experience in both Chinese and Japanese, and am pursuing learning Korean, hoping to one day reach some level of 
fluency in any one of the three languages. On the internet, only paid services seem to give a good way of practicing
and storing vocabulary. At best, you will be spending hours entering word by word into a flash card app that won't let
you access all the vocabulary at once, and lacks other functionality. So I decided to create a bot that was able to do
multiple things. 

First off, the bot has a portion that uses Open-AI to be used at the learners pleasure. This can be used for searching
words, finding out what sentences mean, finding out songs with certain words in them, and so on. Second, the bot will
read off a database (set to be on google sheets), of vocabulary for each of the languages. The sheet will constantly
be updated as the user either mass enters the data on the sheet, or enters singular words with the discord bot 
specifically. The bot will have evolving uses, but the primary one will be to test the user random vocabulary.
The bot will do this both in a singular vocab fashion, and in a rapid round, where the user tries to get as many right
in a certain amount of time.
